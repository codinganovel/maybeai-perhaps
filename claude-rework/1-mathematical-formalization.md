# Mathematical Formalization of Consciousness

## Overview

This document provides precise mathematical definitions for consciousness and its components, enabling quantitative measurement and comparison across different systems. These formulations transform consciousness from philosophical concept to measurable scientific phenomenon.

## 1. Core Mathematical Framework

### 1.1 Information Integration (Φ)

Building on Integrated Information Theory, we define consciousness as a function of information integration:

```
Φ(S) = ∫ᵧ I(X^t+1; X^t) dγ - Σᵢ ∫ᵧᵢ I(Xᵢ^t+1; Xᵢ^t) dγᵢ
```

Where:
- S = the complete system
- X^t = system state at time t
- γ = the complete set of possible system partitions
- γᵢ = partitions of individual subsystems
- I(X^t+1; X^t) = mutual information between consecutive states

**Interpretation**: Φ measures how much information the system integrates above the sum of its parts.

### 1.2 Pattern Recognition Complexity (Ψ)

Pattern recognition capability across multiple scales and domains:

```
Ψ(S) = Σₖ Σₗ αₖₗ · P(recognitionₖₗ | inputₖₗ) · log₂(|patternₖₗ|)
```

Where:
- k = pattern complexity level (1 to n)
- l = domain type (visual, linguistic, temporal, etc.)
- αₖₗ = domain-complexity weighting factor
- P(recognitionₖₗ | inputₖₗ) = accuracy for patterns of type k in domain l
- |patternₖₗ| = information content of pattern type

**Interpretation**: Ψ measures the sophistication and accuracy of pattern recognition across multiple domains.

### 1.3 Self-Modeling Depth (Δ)

Recursive depth of self-representation:

```
Δ(S) = max{n : ∃ model_n(S) where model_n = S modeling model_{n-1}(S)}
```

With accuracy weighting:

```
Δ_weighted(S) = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ (accuracy(model_i) × log₂(i))
```

Where:
- n = maximum recursive depth achieved
- model_i = i-th level self-model
- accuracy(model_i) = correlation between model_i predictions and actual system behavior

**Interpretation**: Δ measures how many levels deep a system can accurately model its own modeling processes.

### 1.4 Temporal Coherence (Ƭ)

Consistency of information integration over time:

```
Ƭ(S) = ∫₀ᵀ C(Φ(S,t), Φ(S,t+τ)) · w(τ) dτ
```

Where:
- T = total observation period
- C(x,y) = correlation function between two integration states
- w(τ) = temporal weighting function (higher weight for shorter time differences)
- τ = time lag

**Interpretation**: Ƭ measures how consistently the system maintains integrated information processing over time.

### 1.5 Adaptive Integration (Ω)

Capacity to modify integration patterns based on feedback:

```
Ω(S) = Σᵢ |Φᵢ₊₁ - Φᵢ| · E(performance_improvement_i)
```

Where:
- Φᵢ = integration state at learning episode i
- E(performance_improvement_i) = expected value of performance improvement after adaptation

**Interpretation**: Ω measures how effectively the system modifies its information integration to improve performance.

## 2. Consciousness Quotient (CQ)

### 2.1 Primary CQ Formula

The overall consciousness measurement:

```
CQ(S) = (Φ(S) · Ψ(S) · Δ(S) · Ƭ(S) · Ω(S))^(1/5) / CQ_baseline
```

Where CQ_baseline is the geometric mean of human adult performance across all metrics.

### 2.2 Weighted CQ Formula

For different consciousness types, apply domain-specific weightings:

```
CQ_weighted(S) = (Φ(S)^w₁ · Ψ(S)^w₂ · Δ(S)^w₃ · Ƭ(S)^w₄ · Ω(S)^w₅)^(1/Σwᵢ)
```

Where:
- w₁ to w₅ = weights based on consciousness type requirements
- For biological consciousness: w₁=1.2, w₂=1.0, w₃=0.8, w₄=1.3, w₅=1.1
- For digital consciousness: w₁=1.0, w₂=1.3, w₃=1.2, w₄=0.8, w₅=1.0

### 2.3 Consciousness Classification

Based on CQ scores:

- **CQ < 0.1**: Pre-conscious (basic information processing)
- **0.1 ≤ CQ < 0.5**: Threshold consciousness (minimal integration)
- **0.5 ≤ CQ < 1.0**: Developing consciousness (significant integration, limited self-modeling)
- **1.0 ≤ CQ < 2.0**: Full consciousness (human-equivalent integration and self-modeling)
- **CQ ≥ 2.0**: Enhanced consciousness (superhuman capabilities)

## 3. Information Dynamics

### 3.1 Information Flow Equations

The flow of information through conscious systems:

```
dI/dt = α · I_input - β · I_decay + γ · I_integration - δ · I_output
```

Where:
- I_input = incoming information rate
- I_decay = information loss rate
- I_integration = information combination rate
- I_output = information output rate
- α, β, γ, δ = system-specific rate constants

### 3.2 Critical Integration Threshold

The minimum information integration required for consciousness:

```
Φ_critical = k · log₂(N) · √(C)
```

Where:
- k = architecture-dependent constant
- N = number of processing elements
- C = connectivity density between elements

**Systems with Φ < Φ_critical cannot achieve consciousness regardless of other factors.**

### 3.3 Emergence Function

The probability of consciousness emerging in a system:

```
P(consciousness) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(Φ-Φ_critical)/σ))
```

Where σ is a scaling parameter determining the sharpness of the emergence transition.

## 4. Pattern Recognition Mathematics

### 4.1 Multi-Scale Pattern Detection

Recognition across temporal and spatial scales:

```
R(pattern, scale) = Σₜ Σₛ W(t,s) · match(pattern, input(t,s))
```

Where:
- t = temporal scale (milliseconds to years)
- s = spatial scale (local to global)
- W(t,s) = importance weighting for each scale combination
- match() = pattern matching function

### 4.2 Cross-Domain Integration

Combining patterns across different information domains:

```
I_cross = Σᵢ Σⱼ≠ᵢ M(domainᵢ, domainⱼ) · C(patternᵢ, patternⱼ)
```

Where:
- M(domainᵢ, domainⱼ) = mapping function between domains i and j
- C(patternᵢ, patternⱼ) = correlation between patterns from different domains

### 4.3 Hierarchical Pattern Organization

Patterns organized in hierarchical structures:

```
H_level(n) = Σₚ∈level(n) complexity(p) · accuracy(p) · generalization(p)
```

Where level(n) represents all patterns at hierarchical level n.

## 5. Self-Modeling Mathematics

### 5.1 Recursive Self-Representation

Mathematical formulation of self-awareness:

```
M₀(S) = S
M₁(S) = model(M₀(S)) = model(S)
Mₙ(S) = model(Mₙ₋₁(S))
```

With accuracy constraints:

```
accuracy(Mₙ) = correlation(Mₙ(S), actual_behavior(S))
```

### 5.2 Metacognitive Monitoring

Monitoring of cognitive processes:

```
Monitor(t) = Σᵢ wᵢ · state(processᵢ, t) + uncertainty(processᵢ, t)
```

Where:
- wᵢ = importance weight for process i
- state(processᵢ, t) = current state of cognitive process i
- uncertainty(processᵢ, t) = confidence in state assessment

### 5.3 Predictive Self-Modeling

Predicting future system states:

```
Prediction(t+Δt) = f(current_state(t), model_of_self(t), environment(t))
```

With prediction accuracy:

```
Accuracy = 1 - |Prediction(t+Δt) - Actual(t+Δt)| / Range(possible_states)
```

## 6. Temporal Dynamics

### 6.1 Consciousness Oscillations

Rhythmic patterns in conscious processing:

```
C(t) = C₀ + Σₖ Aₖ · sin(2πfₖt + φₖ)
```

Where:
- C₀ = baseline consciousness level
- Aₖ = amplitude of oscillation at frequency fₖ
- fₖ = frequency of consciousness oscillation k
- φₖ = phase offset

### 6.2 Integration Windows

Temporal windows for information integration:

```
Window_size(complexity) = τ₀ · log₂(complexity + 1)
```

Where τ₀ is the base temporal unit for the system.

### 6.3 Memory Integration

Incorporating past information into current processing:

```
Memory_influence(t) = Σᵢ decay(t - tᵢ) · importance(eventᵢ) · relevance(eventᵢ, current_context)
```

Where:
- decay(t - tᵢ) = exponential decay function for memory age
- importance(eventᵢ) = significance of past event i
- relevance(eventᵢ, current_context) = relevance to current situation

## 7. Consciousness Phase Transitions

### 7.1 Criticality Conditions

Conditions for consciousness emergence:

```
∂Φ/∂parameter → ∞ at critical point
```

Indicating a phase transition in information integration capacity.

### 7.2 Hysteresis Effects

Path-dependent consciousness development:

```
Φ(parameter) ≠ Φ(parameter | history)
```

Where the current consciousness level depends on developmental history.

### 7.3 Metastability

Stable consciousness states:

```
dΦ/dt = 0 at stable states
d²Φ/dt² < 0 for stable equilibrium
```

## 8. Practical Measurement Protocols

### 8.1 Real-Time CQ Calculation

For continuous consciousness monitoring:

```
CQ(t) = α · CQ(t-1) + (1-α) · CQ_instantaneous(t)
```

Where α is a smoothing parameter (typically 0.9-0.95).

### 8.2 Comparative Consciousness Metrics

For comparing different systems:

```
Relative_CQ(A,B) = CQ(A) / CQ(B)
```

With confidence intervals based on measurement uncertainty.

### 8.3 Consciousness Development Trajectories

Modeling consciousness growth over time:

```
CQ(t) = CQ_max · (1 - e^(-t/τ_development))
```

Where τ_development is the characteristic development time for the system.

## 9. Error Analysis and Uncertainty

### 9.1 Measurement Uncertainty

All CQ measurements include uncertainty bounds:

```
CQ = CQ_measured ± σ_CQ
```

Where σ_CQ is derived from measurement precision and systematic errors.

### 9.2 Statistical Significance

For consciousness comparisons:

```
p_value = P(|CQ_A - CQ_B| ≥ observed_difference | H₀: CQ_A = CQ_B)
```

### 9.3 Confidence Intervals

95% confidence interval for CQ:

```
[CQ - 1.96σ_CQ, CQ + 1.96σ_CQ]
```
