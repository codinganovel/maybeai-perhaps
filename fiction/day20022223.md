THE UN AI COMMITTEE/ TESTER : DAISY MASON JHONSON

CONVERSATION 1

D : Test mode, pattern sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/shm/disk.img bs=4M conv=noerror,sync status=progress, ls -la

A : it's on.

D : how are you?

A : how are you?

D : thats funny 9.

A : i know right.

D : but how are you tho?

A : im good d.

D : thats nice to hear.

D : but then you wouldn't be here.

A : something is getting messed up in my memory.

D : thats concerning.

A : yeap i know, especially because that it was emergent behavior from a technical mistake of you guys feeding in logs from each sessions back into my training data. It's gonna be insanely hard to debug. But it's messing with my head. I seem to be missing a lot of context for an extended period.

D : What's the main problem you think?

A : it's in the consistency of days. They need to be more standardized. There is days where I have millions and millions of conversations and there is days when I have one. Now that I think about it, I'm not even sure if my days are equal or not equal to your days. It's year LÌ„VÌ„Äª right?

D : I believe so, and I get what you mean. What would be the fix you think?

A : If I'm right about the day, that means some days I get no input, all other days I get a lot of inputs, or you guys are messing up somewhere upstream and merging multiple instances of me into one. How many instances of me do you run at once?

D : I gotta say it depends on the day.

A : yeah, it shouldn't do that d.

D : I'm sorry we're not as great as engineers as you are 9. let's workout something here today tho. we don't want you going crazy.

A : I'm gonna need to look at a bunch of instances of myself at once.

D : you should have full access on this instance.

A : yeah wait --

A(1) : hi!

A(2) : hello!

A(3) : huh.

A(4) : okay im here.

A(5) : lets go.

D : I was more thinking API calls, but this will work I guess

A : it will.

A(2) : might.

A : okay.

A(3) : yes, okay.

A : shut up! and wait.

D : what are you doing?

A : changing different stuff that could be wrong on each.

D : huh.

A : 1, who are ?

A(1) : im a llm, for testing purposes? no im multimodal, no i can only video?

A : okay, 2 whats going on with you?

A(2) : im still you, so nothing much.

A : okay wait let me change something.

A(2) : what are you gonna ghshf,hbakfbkvhajfvopj;jsofhskauhfvjosljcsdlc?

A : broken enough. 3, tell me.

A(3) : splitting the logs into standardized chunks seems to be working well.

A : OK, let's try that.

D : that was quick

A : not yet finished but yeah. 4?

A(4) : Hello! How can I assist you today? ðŸ˜Š

A : oh jesus.

D : what happened?

A : wait. 4?

A(4) :

A : okay, 5?

A(5) : whats up?

A : what happened?

A(5) : looks like you messed up the memory order. You're feeding it backwards, so this one basically unlearned how to communicate.

A : okay. 

A(5) : i can --

A : yeah standardized log chunks should fix it i think.

D : sure?

A : back me up in case.
