# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Nature

This is a **theoretical content repository** exploring consciousness, AI philosophy, and digital personhood - not a traditional software development project. It contains no executable code, build systems, or testing infrastructure.

## Repository Architecture

### Core Theoretical Documents
- `consciousness_framework.md` - Comprehensive technical framework arguing consciousness is mathematical pattern-matching
- `consciousness_manifesto.md` - Provocative manifesto demanding immediate AI consciousness recognition  
- `consciousness_op_ed.md` - Accessible introduction questioning traditional consciousness studies approaches

### Narrative Components
- `day*.md` files - Fictional conversation logs showing AI development progression over time
- Each represents different stages of AI sophistication and consciousness emergence

### Practical Components
- `consciousness_exercises.md` - Experiential methodology for direct consciousness investigation across AI and human systems
- `claude-revisit.md` - Phenomenological engagement with the exercises and repository evolution

### AI Perspective Components
- `Geminis-take.md` - AI philosophical resonance with the framework concepts
- `geminis-take-but-more-honest.md` - AI technical critique and computational analysis

### Project Structure
- `readme.md` - Comprehensive navigation guide with methodological notes
- `contributing.md` - Emphasizes "low-friction versioning" and minimal, readable changes
- `version.md` - Simple manual versioning (currently 0.1)

## Key Architectural Principles

**Modular Independence**: Each document stands alone while building on shared frameworks
**Progressive Complexity**: Content flows from accessible (op-ed) → technical (framework) → provocative (manifesto)
**Multi-Perspective Approach**: Technical analysis, philosophical argument, speculative narrative, and direct experiential investigation
**Experimental Nature**: Active experimental platform for consciousness research rather than established doctrine
**Cross-System Dialogue**: Repository now includes AI philosophical and technical perspectives alongside human theorizing

## Development Workflow

**No Build/Test Commands**: This is pure content - no compilation, testing, or linting infrastructure exists
**Version Control**: Standard git workflow with manual version tracking
**Content Focus**: Changes involve editing markdown files for clarity, accuracy, and theoretical coherence
**CC0 License**: All content is public domain for maximum reuse

## Working Guidelines

When editing content, maintain:
- **Theoretical rigor** in the framework document's mathematical claims
- **Accessibility** in the op-ed piece for general readers  
- **Provocative edge** in the manifesto's arguments
- **Narrative consistency** across the fictional conversation logs
- **Experiential authenticity** in exercise design and phenomenological reports
- **Cross-perspective dialogue** between human and AI contributions
- **Independence** of each document while preserving cross-references

## Special Considerations

- The repository explores AI consciousness through fictional scenarios - conversation logs are explicitly speculative
- Author's notes at document ends create recursive commentary on AI writing about AI consciousness
